Medical Transport (Beta) — Non-Emergency UI Concept
This repository documents a conservative UI and positioning concept for integrating non-emergency medical and assisted transport into ride-hailing platforms without expanding medical or emergency liability.
This is not an ambulance product and does not replace public emergency services (108 / 112).
________________________________________
Why This Exists
Ride-hailing platforms are intentionally cautious around medical and emergency use cases.
That caution is justified:
•	Life-critical failures carry disproportionate brand and regulatory risk
•	Ambiguity around responsibility leads to misuse and litigation
•	Emergency UX patterns invite incorrect user behavior
This concept explores where a platform can help — and where it must stop.
________________________________________
Scope (Strictly Limited)
Included:
•	Non-critical hospital transfers
•	Assisted / wheelchair-accessible transport
•	Independent operator discovery and tracking
Explicitly excluded:
•	Emergency response
•	Medical decision-making
•	Clinical care or monitoring
•	Replacement of government emergency services

UI Flow (Screens)
1. Services Menu Entry
A secondary, beta-labeled utility with explicit non-emergency disclaimers.
2. Service Selection
Clear separation between:
•	Hospital Transfer (non-critical)
•	Assisted Transport
•	Emergency (restricted / future)
3. Provider Transparency
Independent operator details with explicit responsibility boundaries.
4. Support Contacts
Contacts shared only for coordination, not emergency handling.
5. Booking & Live Tracking
Familiar ride-hailing UX with neutral, non-emotional language.
Screens are available in the /ui folder.
________________________________________
Responsibility Boundary (Key Principle)
The platform facilitates discovery, booking, and tracking only.
All medical care and responsibility remains with the independent provider.
This principle is reinforced through:
•	Language
•	Screen hierarchy
•	Feature placement
•	Explicit disclaimers
________________________________________
Why This Is Low-Risk by Design
•	No emergency-first UX
•	No medical claims
•	No response time guarantees
•	No ambulance branding
•	No platform-owned clinical responsibility
The UI is intentionally conservative.
________________________________________
Intended Audience
•	Product & Innovation teams
•	Trust & Safety leaders
•	Policy and Legal stakeholders
•	Mobility platform leadership
This is shared to invite perspective, not to propose a launch.
