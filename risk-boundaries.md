This concept is designed around one core constraint:

Do not turn a mobility platform into a medical provider.

Key guardrails:
- Emergency services are redirected, not mediated
- Operators retain medical responsibility
- The platform avoids outcome-based language
- User intent is explicitly constrained through UX

Any deviation from these guardrails increases legal and trust risk.
